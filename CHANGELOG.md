# Changelog

All notable changes to Fabrika are documented here.

Format: each version lists changed files and the nature of the change. Consumer projects use the CHANGELOG to determine which files need updating (see UPDATE.md).

---

## 0.3.1

### Operational Docs (changed — no consumer action needed)
- `UPDATE.md` — **CHANGED.** Step 1 now validates manifest format against MANIFEST_SPEC.md and regenerates non-conformant manifests in-place before proceeding. Replaces the vague "corrupted manifest → re-run ADOPT.md" guidance with specific regeneration instructions. Needed because early consumer projects have inconsistent manifest formats (wrong field names, missing hashes, map-vs-list).

---

## 0.3.0

Harvest from 4 consumer projects (Notnomo, Conduit, Social-engine, Vaultsync) on Fabrika 0.1.0. Bug tracking system, maintenance checklist improvements, scrum-master task system step, and settings permission update.

### Core (changed — consumer projects should update)
- `core/templates/Bug-Report-Template.md` — **NEW.** Structured bug report template with evaluator tracing (`missed-by`, `introduced-by`), root cause analysis sections (code trace + evaluator trace), and eval case linkage. Bugs use separate numbering from stories (BXX).
- `core/bug-workflow.md` — **NEW.** End-to-end bug fix workflow: file → root cause analysis through evaluator history → fix with regression test → create eval case for missed failure mode. Connects bugs to agent quality improvement.
- `core/maintenance-checklist.md` — **CHANGED.** Added "Evaluation Findings Sweep" section between Code Quality and Test Health. Triages non-blocking observations from evaluation reports into trivial (fix now), small (story), or speculative (someday-maybe).
- `core/agents/scrum-master.md` — **CHANGED.** Added step 7: "Create external task entries (if configured)" during sprint planning. Closes gap between CLAUDE.md template (which referenced this) and the agent prompt (which didn't have the step).

### Integrations (changed — consumer projects should update)
- `integrations/claude-code/CLAUDE.md` — **CHANGED.** Added bug tracking system integration: `Bugs/` directory in project structure, bug numbering in Backlog System, Bug Reporting & Fix Workflow subsection in Development Workflow, bug review in Maintenance Sessions summary, bugs as ground truth in Evaluation System lifecycle, bug trigger in Document Creation Triggers table.
- `integrations/claude-code/settings-template.json` — **CHANGED.** Added `TodoWrite` to default permissions allow list.

### Consumer update instructions
Projects on 0.2.0 (or 0.1.0) should:
1. Copy `core/templates/Bug-Report-Template.md` → `docs/Templates/Bug-Report-Template.md` (new file)
2. Copy `core/bug-workflow.md` → `docs/02-Engineering/bug-workflow.md` (new file)
3. Create `docs/04-Backlog/Bugs/` directory
4. Update `docs/02-Engineering/maintenance-checklist.md` — add "Evaluation Findings Sweep" section between Code Quality and Test Health (or re-copy from `core/maintenance-checklist.md` if not customized)
5. Update `.claude/agents/scrum-master.md` from `core/agents/scrum-master.md` (if not customized; if customized, manually add step 7 and renumber)
6. Update `CLAUDE.md` — merge bug system integration points (Bugs/ in structure, bug numbering, Bug Reporting workflow, maintenance summary, evaluation system, document creation triggers)
7. Add `"TodoWrite"` to `.claude/settings.json` permissions.allow

## 0.2.0

Framework relationship documentation and harvest workflow improvements. Consumer projects now understand how local agent changes flow back to canonical Fabrika.

### Core (changed — consumer projects should update)
- `core/FABRIKA.md` — **NEW.** Framework relationship guide placed in consumer projects at `.fabrika/FABRIKA.md`. Explains the eval artifact → harvest → canonical update → propagation flow. Read on demand by agents, not always-loaded.
- `core/templates/Sprint-Retro-Template.md` — **CHANGED.** Added "Fabrika Eval Artifact" section with checklist item so retros can't complete without writing the eval artifact.

### Integrations (changed — consumer projects should update)
- `integrations/claude-code/CLAUDE.md` — **CHANGED.** Replaced verbose Fabrika Relationship section with a 2-line pointer to `.fabrika/FABRIKA.md`. Reduces always-loaded context.

### Operational Docs (changed — no consumer action needed)
- `ADOPT.md` — **CHANGED.** Added merge-not-overwrite protocols for agent files, hooks, .gitignore, and Justfile. Added FABRIKA.md copy step to all tiers. Expanded conflict handling with per-file-type table.
- `BOOTSTRAP.md` — **CHANGED.** Added FABRIKA.md copy step to Phase 1.4.
- `HARVEST.md` — **CHANGED.** Added concrete "How to Run the Harvest" section with three options: copy-paste agent prompt, review system integration, and ad hoc triggers. Added "Verifying Eval Artifacts Exist" troubleshooting section.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — Updated for 0.2.0.
- `VERSION` — Bumped to 0.2.0.

### Consumer update instructions
Projects on 0.1.0 should:
1. Copy `core/FABRIKA.md` → `.fabrika/FABRIKA.md` (new file)
2. Update `docs/Templates/Sprint-Retro-Template.md` from `core/templates/Sprint-Retro-Template.md` (if not customized)
3. Update `CLAUDE.md` — replace the Fabrika Relationship section with the slim 2-line version pointing to `.fabrika/FABRIKA.md` (if the project has one; this was only added post-0.1.0 so some projects may not have it)
